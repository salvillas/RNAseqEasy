# RNAseqEasy package

This package is based on DESeq2, topGO and WGCNA packages in a tidyverse environment. Its purpose is to combine and simplify diffential gene expression, Gene Ontology enrichment, and gene-coexpression clustering analyses and data visualization.

Then, you just need to install `RNAseqEasy` package using `install_github()` function from "salvillas/RNAseqEasy":

``` r
remotes::install_github("salvillas/RNAseqEasy")
```
