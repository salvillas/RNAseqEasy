\arguments{
\item{output_path}{Directory where results will be saved.}

\item{sampleDir}{Directory containing sample folders with quant.sf files.}

\item{sample_table}{Data frame with sample metadata.}

\item{Include}{A vector of condition(s) to include samples from \code{sample_table}.
It will include samples matching this/these condition(s) and exclude all others.
Default to NULL.}

\item{Exclude}{A vector of condition(s) to exclude samples from \code{sample_table}.
Default to NULL.}

\item{tx2gene}{A data frame with columns TXNAME and GENEID (transcript-to-gene mapping).}

\item{Variable}{Character. Column name in sample_table used for grouping.}

\item{Design}{Character. Design formula for DESeq2 (e.g., "~ condition").}

\item{Group}{Character. Whether to use custom contrasts ("YES" or "NO").}

\item{Name}{Character. Base name for output files.}

\item{Contrast}{Character Custom contrasts for DESeq2 results.}

\item{Reduced}{Logical. Whether to use a reduced design (LRT test). Default is FALSE.}

\item{Reduced_design}{A formula specifying the reduced model (required if \code{reduced = TRUE}).}

\item{log2FCtopGO}{Numeric. log2(fold change) threshold for GO analysis. Default is 1.}

\item{ontology}{GO ontology to use ("BP", "MF", "CC"). Defaults to "BP".}

\item{plot_similarity}{Logical, whether to analyze and visualize GO term similarity.}

\item{geneID2GO}{Named list mapping gene IDs to GO terms.}

\item{algorithm}{Algorithm for topGO test (default: "weight01").}

\item{statistic}{Statistical test to use (default: "fisher").}

\item{Number_GOs}{Number of top GO term names to plot in the scatterplot. Defaults to 20.}

\item{orgdb}{OrgDb package name for similarity analysis. Defaults to "org.At.tair.db".}

\item{semdata}{Optional precomputed semantic data.}

\item{save_GeneNames}{Logical, whether to save genes represented by GO terms of interest.}

\item{Annotation}{Two column data frame. First column must include Gene IDs.
Second column must include functional annotation.}

\item{Ontologies}{Character vector of GO terms of interest to search for.}

\description{
This function performs differential expression analysis using DESeq2, optionally
including a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with a reduced design. It also generates
heatmaps and runs GO enrichment analysis for significant genes.
